# Queue explorer

Set an arrival rate and a service time, and see what a single-server queue does with them.

## The shape to remember

Latency does not rise smoothly as a system fills up. It rises slowly, and then it goes vertical
somewhere around 80–90% utilisation. The chart is the point of the tool: at ρ = 0.5 a job waits about
as long as it takes to serve; at ρ = 0.9 it waits nine times that.

The marked line is where your inputs put you.

## The two numbers, and why both are shown

- **Formula** is the closed-form M/M/1 result: exact, instant, and true only under its assumptions
  (arrivals independent and Poisson, service times exponential, one server, infinite queue).
- **Simulation** runs the queue arrival by arrival, using Lindley's recursion, with a seeded random
  number generator.

They should agree to within a percent or two. If they ever disagree by more than that, one of them is
wrong — and that is worth knowing, which is why the difference is displayed rather than hidden. More
samples narrow the gap; it shrinks with the square root of the sample count, so ten times the samples
buys about three times the precision.

## Notes

- The random seed is an input, so the same numbers always produce the same simulation. A simulation
  nobody can reproduce is a simulation nobody can check.
- Above ρ = 1 there is no steady state at all: the queue never drains and every average is infinite.
  The tool says so rather than printing a very large number.
- Real systems are worse than this model, not better: service times with high variance, bursty
  arrivals and shared resources all push the knee to the left.
