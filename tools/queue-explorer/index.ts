/**
 * Queue explorer: why latency goes vertical before a system runs out of capacity.
 *
 * The intuition this exists to fix is expensive to lack. At 80% utilisation an M/M/1 queue holds four
 * jobs; at 95% it holds nineteen. Nobody plans for that curve by reasoning about it, so the tool draws
 * it, marks where you are on it, and shows the same numbers two independent ways.
 *
 * Two things make the code worth reading, and both are the reason this tool is in the example set:
 *
 *  1. **It proves its own arithmetic.** The closed-form M/M/1 result and a discrete-event Monte Carlo
 *     simulation are computed side by side. If they disagree beyond sampling error, one of them is
 *     wrong — and the tool says so rather than quietly presenting the formula as truth.
 *  2. **The randomness is seeded**, so a simulation is a *pure function* of its inputs. That is what
 *     lets a fixture assert a simulated mean, and it is the difference between a demo and something
 *     you can regression-test.
 *
 * It declares `thread: "worker"` because its running time is set by an input: at five million samples
 * it would drop frames on the main thread, and only a worker can be stopped.
