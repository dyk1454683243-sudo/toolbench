/**
 * Runs a tool, on the main thread or in a worker, and reports what happened.
 *
 * **The main thread is the default, and that is a considered choice.** A worker cannot touch the DOM,
 * and for first-party code it buys no security — it is a *stability* boundary, not a sandbox. What it
 * does buy is the only thing that can stop a tool whose running time depends on its input, which is
 * why a tool declares `thread: "worker"` when that describes it and stays on the main thread when it
 * does not.
 *
 * The asymmetry is worth stating plainly, because it decides how much this class can promise:
 *
 * | | main thread | worker |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | Cost to start | none | ~2 ms |
 * | Can be timed out | **no** — nothing to terminate | **yes** |
 * | Can hold the page | yes, if the tool loops | no |
 * | Can draw | yes (not that a tool ever should) | no |
 *
 * On the main thread, `ctx.signal` is the *only* stop mechanism, and it only works if the tool checks
 * it. That is why the manifest rejects `timeoutMs` there: a field that cannot do what it says is worse
 * than no field.
