/**
 * Where tools come from.
 *
 * One interface, so the runtime never knows or cares. Two implementations ship today:
 *
 *  - **`RegistrySource`** — tools the host's bundler already knows about, whether they came from a
 *    local directory or a dependency. This is the everyday case.
 *  - **`FetchSource`** — manifests fetched at runtime, for a host that lists tools dynamically. It
 *    still gets its *modules* from the bundler, for the reason below.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The asymmetry that shapes this file.** A manifest is data and can arrive whenever you like. A
 * module is code, and on a static site there is no way to fetch and run code without `eval` — which
 * means no bundling, no tree-shaking, and a Content-Security-Policy you would rather keep. So a
 * source may resolve *metadata* however it wants, but the *module* must be something the bundler
 * saw. A GitHub-backed source therefore works by generating a registry at build time, not by
 * fetching JavaScript in the browser.
