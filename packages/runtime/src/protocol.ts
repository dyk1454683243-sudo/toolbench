/**
 * The message protocol between the page and a worker.
 *
 * Written out rather than delegated to an RPC library, for a reason that only becomes obvious once
 * you try: **none of `Ctx` can cross a worker boundary.** An `AbortSignal` is not structured-
 * cloneable, `progress` is a function, and a `Response` is neither cloneable nor transferable. So the
 * `Ctx` a tool receives is always constructed on the side that runs it, and these messages are what
 * drive it from the other side.
 *
 * That realisation is also why there is no RPC dependency here: once the protocol is specified, a
 * library adds a wrapper and takes away the one thing a tool harness needs, which is a timeout that
 * can actually stop a running tool.
